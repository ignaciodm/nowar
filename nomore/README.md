# Exercise (3 hours used)
#
- Most situations I believe were modeled.
- This is my first time creating a django project from scratch and using pytest. 
- The project I work has the other main testing library (unittest). 
- I have not worked with pure python developers before, so I do not have a definitive python style.
- I tried to model the exercise using OOP, even I believe these days other techniques, as FP need to
used as a complementary, to avoid as much mutability as possible and have reliable software working.
- The test attempts to show my preference toward having data driven test.
- Things to do, not done: A file per class, better documentation, consistency towards using @property or methods: I used a mix.
- A believe the hierarchy of ArmyBase needs another thought towards naming, and that it is over-engineered at this point.
- Basic OOP patterns detected and used, but could be simpler and with better naming too: builder, factory, composite 
- The 'command' pattern was not needed at this point but could be used to model an attack
